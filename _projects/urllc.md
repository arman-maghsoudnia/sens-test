  This research project aims to explore the feasibility of meeting the stringent requirements of Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) and to design an end-to-end, software-based private 5G network tailored for URLLC applications.

<!-- ## URLLC upperbounds and solution -->
  Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) was introduced in 5G to meet the demanding requirements of latencies as low as 0.5ms and reliability of 99.999% for specific applications. 

  Despite over a decade of discussions on URLLC, achieving these standards in real-world implementations remains challenging. 
  We argue that it is yet unclear if and how URLLC can be attained and a holistic system-level perspective that addresses all the system's inherent bottlenecks is needed. 

  In this project, inspired by a real-world private 5G testbed, we aim to present a comprehensive vision for meeting latency requirements. We will detail the essential design choices across all system layers and formally model latency and reliability metrics, taking into account the dynamics of the entire end-to-end communication system.
